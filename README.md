# Raindrop.io Telegram Bot

This bot allows you to:
* Save raindrops: just forward link to bot, and they'll save it to 'Unsorted'
* Easily share your raindrops: just type `@raindropiobot <search query>` in any chat and pick which raindrop you would like to share. You can use [advanced search operators](https://help.raindrop.io/using-search#operators) there!
* Coming soon: save Telegram posts to Raindrop

This bot requires some configuration. Basically you need to create development app in your Raindrop.io account and share test token with bot. Bot will provide you detailed instruction, don't worry.

## FAQ

> Why not use OAuth?

Yes, we don't use OAuth because (1) I'm lazy to implement it, it's too much hustle, (2) I'm not feeling comfortable disclosing IP of my personal server. 

> Hmmm, I'm not feeling safe using this bot... Won't you steal all my data?

I won't. However, I won't provide any guarantees that your data will be more safe on my server than anywhere else. In case of [suspected] compromising you can always revoke token.

> Still not feeling safe. You can deploy different code and publish here some harmless code

Sure. That's main point of making this bot open source. I made code as much universal as I could, so you can deploy on your own server, check 'Deployment' section below. 


## Deployment

1. Create new telegram bot, enable inline mode.
1. Create `.env` file and put your credentials (including bot token from previous step) there. You can find example in `.env.example`.
1. Install `docker` and `docker-compose` if not already.
1. Install [Telegram Bot server](https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api) (used to download files larger than 20MB). If you would like to use Docker image (from 3rd party tho) you can use this(https://github.com/lukaszraczylo/tdlib-telegram-bot-api-docker)   
1. Run
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
1. You're awesome.

## Development

Restarting docker every time you make changes is a pain. For development, I use `start_local.sh` script which loads `.env` file, overwrites some env variables and runs bot. If you have idea how to make this flow better I'd be very interested, drop me a few lines in the Issues.

1. Create new telegram bot, enable inline mode.
1. Create `.env` file and put your credentials (including bot token from previous step) there. You can find example in `.env.example`.
1. Create virtual env and activate it:
    ```bash
   virtualenv -p python3.9 .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
1. Run bot:
    ```bash
    ./start_local.sh
    ```
